Enderstone Server Software

Enderstone is a project started by BigTeddy98 (Sander), Ferrybig (Fernando) and TimBayens (Tim).
We are trying to make an open-source Minecraft server, with a custom API.

The project is far from finished, but the beginning is there.

The project will be released and may be used under the following licence.
This means you are allowed to use it, change it and publish it, but a credit is required.

The 5 classes in the org/enderstone/server/regions/generators/util package are made by Bukkit, so the credits for that go to them.

Enderstone Server Software

Enderstone is a project started by BigTeddy98 (Sander), Ferrybig (Fernando) and TimBayens (Tim).
We are trying to make an open-source Minecraft server, with a custom API.

The project is far from finished, but the beginning is there.

The project will be released and may be used under the following licence.
This means you are allowed to use it, change it and publish it. When you publish the whole source, or parts of the source code somewhere else a credit to us is required.

The 5 classes in the org/enderstone/server/regions/generators/util package are made by Bukkit, so the credits for that go to them.

We use the JNBT library to read and write our NBT data. When you use and/or redistribute source located in the org.jnbt package, you accept to the license of JNBT, which can be found in the JNBT_LICENSE.TXT file.
All credits of the JNBT library (located in the org.jnbt package) go to them.

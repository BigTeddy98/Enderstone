Enderstone Server Software

GLOBAL INFORMATION
=========
Enderstone is a project started by BigTeddy98 (Sander), Ferrybig (Fernando) and TimBayens (Tim).
We are trying to make an open-source Minecraft server with a custom API, without using any Mojang Minecraft Server code.

The project is currently using protocol version 47, which means that only Minecraft 1.8 clients will be able to connect.

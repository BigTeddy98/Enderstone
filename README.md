Enderstone Server Software

Enderstone is a project started by BigTeddy98 (Sander), Ferrybig (Fernando) and TimBayens (Tim).
We are trying to make an open-source Minecraft server with a custom API.

The project is far from finished, but the beginning is there.

Library licenses:

The 5 classes in the org/enderstone/server/regions/generators/util package are made by Bukkit, so the credits for that go to them.

We use the JNBT library to read and write our NBT data. When you use source located in the org.jnbt package, you accept to the license of JNBT, which can be found in the JNBT_LICENSE.TXT file.
All credits of the JNBT library (located in the org.jnbt package) go to them.
